# InteliJ HotKey Flashcards

I've been using IntelliJ IDEs for a couple of years now and decided I wanted to be more efficient with the hotkeys to make the experience smoother and faster. As a way to drill in and become faster with hotkey usage, I am making this Flutter desktop app.

### Things I still need to work on:

- Lots of formatting things
    - Formatting the prompts
- Increase the number of HotKeys in the list
- Refactoring some code to make it more modular and easier to read and reuse
- Research the difference in hotkeys between OS version and Windows versions of InteliJ
